# SmartGreenhouse

This project programs a Raspberry Pi with two sensors (DHT11 and a soil humidity sensor) to measure temperature and soil humidity. Additionally, an AI model is used for real-time analysis via a connected camera.

## Features
1. Monitor temperature and soil humidity.
2. Integrate AI-based camera analysis.

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi
- DHT11 Sensor
- Soil Humidity Sensor
- Camera
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras for AI

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smartgreenhouse.git
   cd smartgreenhouse
